I've found that writing todo lists enormously increases my productivity while programming. Programming is all about breaking larger problems into smaller problems over and over until the problems are small enough to solve easily. Lists provide a map of the problems that need solving and make it possible to work on a smaller subset of them without having to simultaneously worry about the global structure of the program.

I'd like to learn more about creating computer programs able to play board games; to that end, over the next day or two I'm going to be working on an AI for 8&#215;8 Connect 4 and try to accomplish the following:

1.  Implement a Minimax algorithm using javascript since game logic and GUI are already written. The heuristic evaluation function will probably count the number of winning moves available to both players.
2.  Add alpha-beta punning to the Minimax algorithm.
3.  Create a Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm for Connect 4. I'm not currently very familiar with this technique, but based on what I've read so far, it looks like it is [state of the art][1].
4.  Have the programs play each other (with similar run times) and post the results.
