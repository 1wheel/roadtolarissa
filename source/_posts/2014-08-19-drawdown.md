The [drawdown][1] of a series is the largest decrease in value between two points. If you were to purchase and sell a stock, the start and end of its drawdown would be the worst time to do so. 

Since order matters, calculating drawdown isn't as simple as finding the maximum and minimum values of the series - if the minimum occurs before the maximum, such an approach will identify a period of appreciation. To avoid this case, we can iterate over each index <span class='i-text'>`i`</span> of the series, then compare the price at time <span class='i-text'>`i`</span> to the price at all subsequent indices <span class='j-text'>`j`</span>. <span class='maxDrawdown-text'>`maxDrawdown`</span> is equal to the largest difference between prices at <span class='i-text'>`i`</span> and <span class='j-text'>`j`</span>:

```javascript
var n = prices.length
for (var i = 0; i < n; i++){
    for (var j = i + 1; j < n; j++){
        dif = prices[i] - prices[j];
        maxDrawdown = maxDrawdown > dif ? maxDrawdown : dif; 
    }
}
```

While accurate, this algorithm require many value comparisons:

If the series has <span class='n-text'>`n`</span> prices, `n*(n - 1)/2` comparisons are needed (the number of comparisons done during the <span class='i-text'>`i`</span>th pass through the inner loop is `n - i - 1`; the [sum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number) of all those comparisons is `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n - 1`). The number of comparisons increases faster than `n` - if there are `100` values, `4950` comparisons are needed, while `200` values requires `19900` comparisons. For series covering a long period of time or with a great deal of granularity, this algorithm might be too slow even for a fast computer.

Instead of comparing every value with every other value, we can exploit the sequential requirement and make only `n - 1` comparisons: 

```javascript
var peak = 0;
var n = prices.length
for (var i = 1; i < n; i++){
    dif = prices[peak] - prices[i];
    peak = dif < 0 ? i : j; 
    maxDrawdown = maxDrawdown > dif ? maxDrawdown : dif; 
}
```

Iterating over each index <span class='i-text'>`i`</span> of the series in order, the maximum decline ending at point <span class='i-text'>`i`</span> will start at the highest point of the series so far. While passing over the series we keep track of two numbers - the <span class='peak-text'>`peak`</span> of the series and the <span class='maxDrawdown-text'>`maxDrawdown`</span> in price between <span class='peak-text'>`peak`</span> and <span class='i-text'>`i`</span>. 

<div id='oN' style='width: 100%; height: 300px'></div>

The speed difference between the two algorithms is proportional to the number of prices. Calculating drawdown with the second approach on a series with `100` values takes `99` comparisons instead of `4950`, which is `50` (`100/2`) times faster. A series with `200` values requires `199` comparisons instead of `19900`, which is `100` (`200/2`) times faster. In general, since the first approach requires `n*(n - 1)/2` comparisons for a series with <span class='n-text'>`n`</span> values and the second `n - 1` comparisons, the second approach will be `n/2` times faster.
