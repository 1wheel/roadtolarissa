The drawdown of a series refers to largest decrease in value between two points. If you were to purchase and sell a stock, the start and end of stock's drawdown would be the worst time to do so. Conversely, if you had perfect knowledge of stock's price and the ability to buy and sell a short once, you'd want to identify the drawdown period in order to maximize profits. 

Since order matters, calculating drawdown isn't as simple as finding the maximum and minimum values of the series - if the minimum occurs before the maximum, such an approach will identify a period of application. To avoid this case, we could iterate over each index of the series `i`, then compare the price at time `i` to the price at all subsequent times `j`. Max drawdown is equal to the largest difference between prices at `i` and `j`:

```javascript 
for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){
    for (var j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++){
        dif = prices[i] - prices[j];
        maxDrawdown = maxDrawdown > dif ? maxDrawdown : dif; 
    }
}
```

While accurate, this algorithm require many value comparisons:

If the series has `n` prices, `n*(n - 1)/2` comparisons are needed (the number of comparisons done during `i`th pass through of the inner loop is n - i - 1; the [sum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number) of all those comparisons is `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n - 1`). The number of comparisons increases faster than `n` - if there are 100 values, 4950 comparisons are needed, while 200 values requires 19900 comparisons. For series covering a long period of time or with a great deal of granularity, this algorithm might be too slow even for a fast computer.

Instead of comparing every value with every other value, we can exploit the sequential requirement to only make `n - 1` comparisons. While 

If the point we're at is higher than all previous points, if it is a `peak`, any subsequent drawdown periods must start at the `peak` or another `p`

```javascript 
for (var i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){
    dif = prices[peak] - prices[i];
    peak = dif < 0 ? i : j; 
    maxDrawdown = maxDrawdown > dif ? maxDrawdown : dif; 
}
```
