Ever since the certificate on [Kouio](http://kouio.com/) expired, I've been looking for a replacement RSS reader without fiddly swipping actions or distracting sticky elements. 

Hosting my own application and database seemed like too much work to just to display some text in a column until I saw [osmosfeed](https://github.com/osmoscraft/osmosfeed) this weekend. It's essentially a script that pulls down RSS feeds and bakes them out into a static page once a dayâ€”much less maintenance!

osmosfeed's UI wasn't quite what I was looking for either, but just the idea of working with static files made things simple enough to bang out a prototype, shown below, in [200 lines of code](https://github.com/chart-code/static-rss). 

No database imposes significant limitations (read status doesn't sync ðŸ˜”), but as a [home-cooked app](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/) it's possible to try new ideas* until everything is just right and then trust it won't change for years. 

\* One here that I wish twitter had: only showing the most recent five or ten items per feed so less frequent posters don't get drowned out.
