 The computer will analyze the patterns in your key strokes and predict your next input. Typically it is correct around 70% of the timeâ€”humans have a hard time acting randomly.

## How does it work?

The looks at ngrams, sequences of four character

Knowing what the computer computer will guess, you can guarantee that it is always wrong by picking the other direction. Doing the *opposite* of what a computer tells you isn't quite free will though!

Inspired by [Nick Merrill's](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nick/aaronson-oracle/index.html) implementation of [Scott Aaronson's program](https://github.com/elsehow/aaronson-oracle).

A similar approach works for [Rock-Paper-Scissors](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/rock-paper-scissors.html). Each level of the tree will branch three times instead of two. 

Human generated random inputs are distinguishable from true random noise along a variety of statistical measures; with practice, humans can produce inputs closer to [random noise](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Allen_Neuringer/publication/232494603_Can_People_Behave_Randomly_The_Role_of_Feedback/links/02e7e51fec79d7ff8c000000.pdf).
