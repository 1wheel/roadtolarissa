After [Baehr v. Miike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baehr_v._Miike) raised the possibly of courts requiring states to grant same sex marriage licenses, state legislatures stated passing laws banning same sex marriage and recognition of out of state sames sex marriages. 

To prevent theses laws from being overturned, conservatives campaigned to amended state constitutions to explicitly ban same sex marriage. In November 2004, 11 states had one of the ballot measures up for a vote. All of them [passed](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6383353/ns/politics/t/voters-pass-all-bans-gay-marriage/). 

[Obergefell v. Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) legalized same sex marriage across the country in 2015.
