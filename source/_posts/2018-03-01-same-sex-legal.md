After [Baehr v. Miike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baehr_v._Miike) raised the possibly of courts requiring states to grant same-sex marriage licenses, state legislatures started passing laws banning same-sex marriage and recognition of out-of-state sames sex marriages. 

To prevent these laws from being overturned by state courts, conservatives campaigned to amend state constitutions to explicitly ban same-sex marriage. In November 2004, 11 states had one of the ballot measures up for a vote. All of them [passed](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6383353/ns/politics/t/voters-pass-all-bans-gay-marriage/). 

[Obergefell v. Hodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) legalized same-sex marriage across the country in 2015.
