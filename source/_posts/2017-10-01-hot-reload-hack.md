Ever since seeing Brett Victor [live code mario](https://vimeo.com/242837481), I've wanted a more interactive of writing code.

I tried using other programming languages, but that gets in the way of writing plan old javascript that runs so well on other computers. [Live reload] is also nice, but that flash of white is just about the worst thing you can do when working with before and after comparisons.

Eventually, I figured out a simple solution combining to bits of technology: file watching and websockets. 

## websockets + chodir


## requirejs


## browserify


## rollup


## Other optiions
