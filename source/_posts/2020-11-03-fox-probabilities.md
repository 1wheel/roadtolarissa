The [Fox win probability dials](https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/general-results/probability-dials) only show their current win probabilities. I noticed the Florida forecast [jumping around](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce/status/1323794382391304194) and wanted to see what the odds looked like over time. 

As of 9:50 PM, Florida has settled down but Fox still shows Biden as having a much better chance in Georgia and North Carolina than the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/forecast-president.html). Nate Cohn [thinks](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1323820129197740040) this might be a result of the Fox model not be taking into account the type of vote outstanding.
