Every December, Pitchfork ranks their top 50 albums of the year. This year they also picked the [top 200 albums of the 2010s](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-albums-of-the-2010s/).

_Fame Monster_ and _Red_ made the best of the decade, but not the best of the year.

Some previously highly regarded artist didn't make the cut. James Blake and How to Dress Well both had three best of the year albums and nothing in best of the decade; their later work that scored a 5.8 and 6.8 respectively might have removed some of previous luster. Others, like Sun Kil Moon and Ariel Pink, dropped off after misogynistic on-stage behavior. 

[Brookyln Vegan](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/albums-pitchfork-liked-less-over-time-according-to-their-decade-list/) has a qualitative analysis of who is up and who is down.
