The trickiest part of this piece was finding the right data source. We wanted frequently updating, hourly data to show where the rain was falling the hardest and how much had fallen overall. 

I started looking at the [Global Precipitation Measurement Constellation](https://pmm.nasa.gov/data-access/downloads/gpm) which has data on rainfall around the world in 30 minute slices released on 6 hour lag. After spending a few hours figuring out how to open up netCDF files, I realized the data wasn't updated as regularly as I hoped. Coloring the data points by observation time showed the paths of [satellites](http://imgur.com/lgjC75m) [moving](http://imgur.com/cFAL1iC) across the sky. Since not every point gets updated at the same time or on the same interval, calculating cumulative rainfall was trickier than just summing the hourly interval - too tricky to do on deadline. 

After spending most of a Saturday wandering down a dead end, I was ready to give up. Until Anjali found a [NOAA ftp server](http://www.srh.noaa.gov/data/ridge2/Precip/qpehourlyshape/2017/201708/20170828/) with exactly the data I was looking for! The format was a bit strange - a shapefile with a [grid of points](http://imgur.com/Vgh8uZS) showing calculated rainfall. I threw together a rough script to download download the last few days of observations, combine them into a csv and [plot the values](http://imgur.com/5jo48l0). 

Since both the cumulative and the hourly rainfall were interesting, I tried a bivariate color 
scale to trace the hurricane's path in red. You can see the [eye](http://imgur.com/yeJyHxs) of the hurricane as it lands! All the colors were a little too much to explain in a key though, so we switched to circles to show the current path of the hurricane. We also had to cut down on the spatial resolution to keep the file size under control - maybe a video would have been better, but I'm a big fan of tiny charts inside of tooltips.
