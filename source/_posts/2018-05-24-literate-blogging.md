For five years, I was frustrated by every blogging engine I tried. 

WordPress made it difficult to embed inline interactive charts. Octopress's predefined css was hard to disable and pasting Stack Overflow instructions on installing gems without understanding what `renv` or `rvm` were eventually broke my ruby installation. Metalsmith was easier, but I never managed to successfully configure the rss plugin.

And none of alternatives I looked at supported [hot reloading](https://roadtolarissa.com/hot-reload).

Writing my own blogging software seemed like epitome of yak shaving. I thought it would be difficult, too,  until I came across Jeremy Ashkenas's [Jorno](http://ashkenas.com/journo/docs/journo.html) and Rich Harris's [Svelte blog](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte.technology/blob/1fc419a37aa47cc54eaa8e65661bd80894a653b0/scripts/prep/build-blog.js) last summer. Using their code as a starting point, I spent a lazy Sunday simplifying my setup. 

Now this site is built with just **60 lines of code**. And they're run directly off of this post.

## How It Works

Each post is a markdown file in the `source/_posts` folder. The posts get read in, parsed and written out to `public/` as an HTML file using one of templates from `source/_templates`.

Static files that don't need preprocessing, like images or javascript, are copied directly from `source/` to `public/` with `rysnc` in preperation for publishing. 

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
var {exec, execSync} = require('child_process')

var public = `${__dirname}/../../public`
var source = `${__dirname}/../../source`

function rsyncSource(){
  exec(`rsync -a --exclude _posts --exclude _templates ${source}/ ${public}/`)
}
rsyncSource()
```

Markdown is converted to HTML with [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) and syntax highlighted by [highlight.js](). 

```javascript
var hljs = require('highlight.js')
var marked = require('marked')
marked.setOptions({
  highlight: (code, lang) => hljs.highlight(lang, code).value,
  smartypants: true
})
```

Files in the `_templates` directory, currently `rss.xml`, `sitemap.xml` and  `post.html`,  are ES6 template strings.  `eval` turns them into functions that can be passed data. 

```javascript
var templates = {}
readdirAbs(`${source}/_templates`).forEach(path => {
  var str = fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8')
  var templateName = path.split('_templates/')[1]
  templates[templateName] = d => eval('`' + str + '`')
})

function readdirAbs(dir){ return fs.readdirSync(dir).map(d => dir + '/' + d) }
```

Each post file in the `source/_posts` folder is read in with `parsePost` and saved to the `posts` array.

Instead of having to install and configure a plugin, I created an rss feed by passing the array of posts to the `rss.xml` template and writing out a file. 

```javascript
var posts = readdirAbs(`${source}/_posts`).map(parsePost)
fs.writeFileSync(public + '/rss.xml',  templates['rss.xml'](posts))
fs.writeFileSync(public + '/sitemap.xml', templates['sitemap.xml'](posts))
```

Passed the path of a post, `parsePost` reads the title, url, date and publish status from [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) at the top of the post. The markdown body is converted to an HTML fragment and an object representing the post is returned.

```javascript
function parsePost(path){
  var [top, body] = fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8')
    .replace('---\n', '')
    .split('\n---\n')

  var post = {html: marked(body)}
  top.split('\n').forEach(line => {
    var [key, val] = line.split(/: (.+)/)
    post[key] = val
  })

  return post
}
```


`writePost` takes a post object, creates a folder for it in `public/`, runs it through a template and writes out the post to `index.html`. 

```javascript
function writePost(post){
  var dir = public + post.permalink
  if (!fs.existsSync(dir)) execSync(`mkdir -p ${dir}`)
  fs.writeFileSync(`${dir}/index.html`, templates[post.template](post))
}
posts.forEach(writePost)
```

And that's all the code that's needed to build the blog!

To get it all on the internet `npm run publish` runs [lit-node](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/lit-node) on this post to regenerate everything locally, then uses `rsync` again to copy the `public` directory to a remote folder that's being statically served.

```json
"scripts": {
  "publish": "lit-node source/_posts/2018-05-24-literate-blogging.md && 
    rsync -a public/ demo@roadtolarissa.com:../../usr/share/nginx/html/",
  "start": "lit-node source/_posts/2018-05-24-literate-blogging.md --watch & 
    cd public/ && hot-server"
}
```

`npm run start` runs [hot-server](https://github.com/1wheel/hot-server) in the `public` folder and runs this post with the `--watch` flag. Changes in the `source` directory rerun `rsyncSource`, which copies the the update file to `public`, triggering hot-server's file watch and passing the file to the browser along a websocket. A little Rube Goldberg, but still plenty fast and simpler than rewriting hot-server here.  

Edits to a post rebuild just that post, making hot-server trigger a page reload.

```javascript
if (process.argv.includes('--watch')){
  require('chokidar').watch(source).on('change', path => {
    rsyncSource()
    if (path.includes('_posts/')) writePost(parsePost(path))
  })
}
```

I don't spend much time looking at `sitemap.xml` or tweaking the templates, so they're not hooked up to automatically update. I've tried to only implement exactly what I need without any unnecessary abstractions to keep the code easy to work with. Writing both the code and content lets you aggressively cut corners.

## Make Your Own

I'm not totally sold on literate programming yet. I quite liked the having all the code fit on one screen and [âŒ˜-B](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/build_systems.html) doesn't work out of the box. But I've been asked a couple of times for advice on putting words and charts on the internet without <img src='https://i.imgur.com/J1MBJU6.png' style='height: 1.2em; position: relative; top: 4px;' alt='Medium App Nag'></img> getting plastered all over it. Hopefully this post shows how far a little glue code can go when paired with a folder of markdown files, `rsync` and a static server.

If you'd like to try it without futzing with the literate bits, there's a [javascript only](https://github.com/1wheel/roadtolarissa/blob/master/source/literate-blogging/index.js) version.

<!-- 

This is that post on every blog about how the blog is set up

i've finally written that blog post about how the blog is set up 

thx everyone

over engineered nicar setup 

This could be risky, but writting both the code and content lets you cut corners.

TODO

- sylink atom to rss
