A [paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/10/2009637117/) published last week arguing for mask usage has been [heavily criticized](https://twitter.com/KateGrabowski/status/1271542361244352514) for, among other things, a tenuous analysis of a [regression discontinuity](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/06/25/another-regression-discontinuity-disaster-and-what-can-we-learn-from-it/).

Fitting lines to the number of new cases each day in New York City <span class='underline'>before</span> and <span class='underline'>after</span> face masks were mandatory, the authors attribute the steeper decline in cases to face masks. New cases were falling by 39 per day before the order and 106 after, so face masks probably sped up the rate of decrease by about 67 cases a day.

There's some bold claims along the way ("After April 3, the only difference in the regulatory measures between NYC and the United States lies in face covering on April 17 in NYC"), but let's take a closer look at mechanics of this regression. 

With large day-of-week patterns, it is extremely sensitive to the exact start and end dates â€” can you tweak them to make a chart recommending _against_ mask usage?

These small adjustments aren't unreasonable. [Mobility](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) decreased before the lockdown order; the mask order had a [three-day grace period](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/nyregion/coronavirus-face-masks-andrew-cuomo.html). And there's a variable lag between infections and positive tests that the paper doesn't engage with. With fuzzy boundaries a [local linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) would be more appropriate, but it's not really possible to do [causal inference](https://twitter.com/NoahHaber/status/1271578680922267649) with case counts from just three regions like this paper attempts. 

A [growing body](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v2/download) of [evidence](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1279750/retrieve) supports mask usage. Shoddy statistics published in PNAS (with disconcertingly positive [initial expert reactions](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-a-study-looking-at-mandatory-face-masks-and-number-of-covid-19-infections-in-new-york-wuhan-and-italy/) and [continued public popularity](https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnas.org%2Fcontent%2Fearly%2F2020%2F06%2F10%2F2009637117&src=typed_query&f=live)) will make it harder to [communicate](https://twitter.com/jeremyfaust/status/1271572240010809347) the results of future research, especially after mask recommendations have changed. The paper's abstract puts it well: "sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics."
