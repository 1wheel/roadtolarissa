Finishing up the circular synth, I got a little frustrated by its inability to save more than 4 measures of music. While there was a clear connection between the interface and the music, there wasn't anyway to communicate its most enjoying aspect - changing a few notes every cycle, creating a composition.

With these gears, I've tried to visually represent this process of change. The orange functions much like the first circular synth. Each arc reprsents a note, with distance from the center of the circle corrisponding to pitch and column to one of eight beats. When the beat passes the lefthand side of the circle, it is highlighted yellow and filled in notes are played.

The large orange and green gears have 72 teeth, the small green gear 8 and the pink gear 63. Every 7 beats the orange and green gears turns 7/8s of the way around. This turns the small green gear 7 teeth ahead, also turning the pink gear 7 teeth or 7/63 = 1/9. Since the pink gear has nine beats, this advances it exactly one beat. When a pink beat passes the left side of the circle, it flashes blue and any of its filled in notes invert the fill state of the oragane notes across from them.

Every 63 (7*9) beats, the pink gear completes one rotation while the orange gear rotates 7 and 7/8th times. After 8 rotations of the pink gear or 504 (7*8*9) beats
