Type the words in time with music!

Made at [NYC Monthly Music Hack](http://monthlymusichackathon.org/). Code on [github](https://github.com/1wheel/roadtolarissa/tree/master/source/javascripts/posts/lyricType).

Hearing lyrics while typing them creates an interesting [synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia) like effect, recontextualizing familar music. One of my favorite games [Audiosurf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiosurf) also did this, mixing songs and puzzle matching together. 

I made [version](https://github.com/1wheel/typing) of this typing game three years ago, one of my first javascript programs.  On a day to day basis, sometimes it feels like I'm not learning much more about programming, but something must be adding up - it took just a few hours to write this time instead of a few weeks. 

The previous version was built on the now defunct Spotify desktop app platform and decrypted tunewiki's .
