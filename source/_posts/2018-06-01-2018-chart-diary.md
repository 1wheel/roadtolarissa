## [Is There Something Wrong with Democracy?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/24/world/is-there-something-wrong-with-democracy.html)

Larry [sketched out](https://imgur.com/9gl9sPf) a Hans Rosling style connected scatter plot about democracy and I turned it into an [unstyled animation](https://imgur.com/XiKMDYi) with a bit of d3. 

The tricky bit: he was producing an actual video, not a webpage. I found an objectively bad way of [exporting](https://roadtolarissa.com/d3-mp4/) a d3 animation as a video by taking a bunch of screenshots with a headless browser and stitching them together.

I wish there was an easier way of doing this. [Chart Party](https://imgur.com/tEN3bkf---https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_SsIKgwvz4) does incredibly creative work and I think some of that's because video lets you walk people through complex forms in a way that's even more friendly than scrolling. I'd like to try, but learning a whole new way of working, especially with something that requires sharing more of yourself, is [daunting](https://imgur.com/zgthTOM---https://www.youtube.com/user/jonbois/videos).



## [The Rise and Fall of Same-Sex Marriage Bans](https://roadtolarissa.com/same-sex-legal/)

Basically a stacked bar chart with two twists. 

First, labeling the states lets you follow an individual state over time. States that change are highlighted with bolding and tweaking the sort order so you can easily count how many states switched into each group. This doesn't do great job highlighting which group the state [switched from](https://imgur.com/a/gWSUy), but that's not too important here since the progression is always No Law → Ban → Legal.  

Second, the baseline is adjusted to puts more emphasis on the total number of places with bans. Originally the that No Law always sits in middle of the chart

## [Rich White Boys Stay Rich. Black Boys Don’t](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html)

Amanda and Kevin did most of the charting work on this piece - I just got pulled in as an expert dot animator. 

We started out with a [SVG animation](https://bl.ocks.org/1wheel/7ddedc637c07104886f6909215a41b7f), tried out Elijah's [canvas sankey particles](https://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/e9d64d27f286e61493c9) and ended up rewriting in regl to get more dots on the screen.

The final version gets better performance by passing in [array of attributes](https://bl.ocks.org/1wheel/9b3bcc4ce8266913c0a0ddd4120a41de) to the vertex shader - after publishing the very helpful [regl chat](gitter.im/mikolalysenko/regl) showed me how to fix.

This piece probably has the worst data to ink ratio of anything I've made; 10,000 dots to show 10 data points. I think it would have been interesting to try show more of distributions across race/sex/parent income at once, but when you've got such important numbers going on big a couple of them can work.

I got a reader email complaining how long it took watch the animation. I made a [static version](https://bl.ocks.org/1wheel/1629f9dbc0d48137ac3a8cb395e5ec4c) incorporating some of his suggestions. Definitely more information dense,  but it doesn't have quite the same impact.  


## [Every Top Three Grossing Movie Over The Last 25 Years](https://roadtolarissa.com/top-3-movies/)

After seeing Axios's [piece](https://www.axios.com/black-panther-box-office-titanic-top-3-north-america-avatar-star-wars-32a35770-59fc-4ccc-bd5b-3a85d7144266.html) on Black Panther becoming one of the highest (non-inflation adjusted) grossing movies of all time, I was curious how many other movies had done so. Originally, I copied the step interpolation - it looks cool! - [but Lisa's post](https://imgur.com/3NiBsQL---https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-altitude/) convinced me that it was a little misleading for continuous cumulative data. 

I like the scrubbability of seeing the scale suddenly increase when there's a new record, but some of the drama gets lost if you scroll too quickly. Updating the y scale elastically (like this [this path](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-redistricting/) or [this zoom](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/27/world/greenland-is-melting-away.html)) instead of instantly might have worked better. 

Grabbing data from Axios instead of having to find it, scrape it and check for errors is the best. In theory, I should have updated with more recent data (Infinity War!) and gotten a better sample of top grossing movies in the 80s...

## [Selling Low and Buying High Can Beat the Market](https://roadtolarissa.com/sell-strat/)

I got the idea for this piece after Feburary dip in stock prices and seeing comments like ["I like to look at it as stocks going on sale. Time to buy!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7vngon/dont_sell_the_stocks_in_your_retirement_portfolio/dttomu6/). Is it actually better to buy after a dip in prices? Or should you sell?

[Elliot Bently](http://ejb.github.io/2017/06/25/trading-bot-sketches.html) made a [trading simulator](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/build-your-own-trading-bot/) for the WSJ last year that came close to answering my question, but getting trying to understand impact of tweaking the trading thresholds required [fiddling](https://i.imgur.com/uFl91hM.png) with a text field and waiting for an animation to play. [Animations](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-win-a-trade-war/) are good for introducing a concept, but they start to get frustrating when they block interaction. 

Besides disabling the animation, I took a step and a half up the [ladder of abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) and showed the entire space of different trading thresholds with a series of [heatmaps](https://i.imgur.com/zPehFto.png). People don't click on buttons as much as we'd like to image and mobile is a huge design constraint, but I don't think graphics desks are exploiting the possiblies of the medium when we don't give readers a chance to explore and examine our models without pulling down an IPython Notebook.

Making something like this is more work; the [rough draft](https://bl.ocks.org/1wheel/raw/18b49093b0a41888d4ff45281cb66f66/0b4c9ee45c6d625c7fdd48101963cdb70de190fa/) got [banged out](https://i.imgur.com/zNzmoCq.png) in an evening, but all the polishing touches took [more time](https://i.imgur.com/zPehFto.png) to get right and the [code](https://github.com/1wheel/roadtolarissa/blob/master/source/sell-strat/_script.js) ended up pretty ugly (didn't want to prematurally optimize, but dragging the date slider was laggy so I hacked in caching without cleanly rewriting thinking the finish line was close… it wasn't).

## [How 2 M.T.A. Decisions Pushed the Subway Into Crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/09/nyregion/subway-crisis-mta-decisions-signals-rules.html)

[Hard to sum this one up](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce/status/1008340664315236352)

## [LeBron James Is Carrying the Cavaliers in a Historic Way](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/08/sports/basketball/lebron-nba-finals.html)

Missed my chance to make something about the Spurs 50 win streak, but still got my yearly LeBron chart in. He's pretty good!

The design on the main chart didn't change too much from my [first sketch](https://bl.ocks.org/1wheel/raw/23837f1a9f5734a3e9e7a694b32a6aa3/). The gap between players each year ends up a little too emphasized with the lines, but the connection really helps recall each year. Plus it looks nice. Kevin suggested a bar chart version with space for all the players names, but year encoding gets a little messy and including the 0 baseline makes the chart less dramatic.

I added [labels](https://i.imgur.com/pklAgmR.png) for a few players and was thinking using the little stat cards as a tooltip. Joe suggested laying out the cards out by player so you could see their details [without interacting](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#interactivity_considered_harmful) (it makes a little bar chart [in print](https://i.imgur.com/jYHrPqF.png)!). Without anything to put in the tooltip, I tried just showing the [name](https://i.imgur.com/ayXUpjr.gifv) on hover. 

That was super frustrating to use though; it takes so much mousing overing to read the chart. So I shrunk the circles and printed all the names directly on the chart.

Archie thought barbell chart needed a simpler introduction. I had planned on making a game-by-game stats share for every finals team, like I did for [total playoff points](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/25/sports/basketball/lebron-career-playoff-points-record.html) last year. The cards used the historic small multiples space, so I put a bigger 2018 game-by-game chart on top. Was originally going to stack them on mobile, but Archie pointed out that you really want to see them side by side so I squeeze them together, dropping the player labels and [reusing the y axis](https://i.imgur.com/8ol1aZo.png). Wish I could have got some annotations in, but couldn't find space : /

The top still wasn't simple so we put in 2018 LeBron stat card to intro the piece.


## [Energized Democrats Are Voting in Competitive Primaries in Droves](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/25/us/politics/midterm-primaries-voter-turnout.html)

About 30 seconds after walking back into the office post paternity leave, Tom grabbed me: "Do you have a minute? We want to look at Democratic primary turnout."

I put my bag down and started pulling party turnout numbers from secretary of state websites. The mechanics of party registration vary state to state, and states that did breakdown turnout by party were slow to post results. So we tried counting voters by just summing votes for Democratic and Republican candidates. House races didn't work for this--lots of seats don't have a primary--but we could compare turnout in states with a governor or senate race in 2014 and 2018. It [looked interesting](https://imgur.com/Ylxufyt), but there wasn't quite enough there to hang a story on. 

So we decided to zoom in and compare turnout in house races. My first attempt was a [log scaled scatter plot](https://imgur.com/0qk98KV) showing how turnout shifted for both parties. Nice and dense!  After [annonations](https://imgur.com/XRal9cV) didn't increase readabilty though we started to worry it might be too hard. I still think might have been doable with some [rotation](https://imgur.com/p12xa7D---https://roadtolarissa.com/nba-win-loss/) and quadrant labeling.

Larry suggested trying out a simpler form, so I sketched the [distrubution](https://imgur.com/zp7AoeP) of how turnout shifted for each party in each race. This suggested a simpler metric: instead of trying to show how both parties' turnout changed, just use the change in [partisan vote share](https://imgur.com/y6ratvF). Haeyoun was curious if the Democratic share was up more in competive races, so I made a [slope charts](https://imgur.com/NGSnPvr) faceted by the race's Cook rating. Since we didn't have data on a ton of races (the AP only reports vote totals for contested primaries and we needed vote totals in for both parties in both years; a surprising number of primaries go uncontested), I switched over to [small multiples slope charts](https://imgur.com/5cj2z2F) which needed even less explanation. To empahsise the direction of the slope even more, we put all the races that increased their Democratic turnout on the left. Pulling the competive races, all of which had increased Democratic vote share, to the top kept the breakdown that Haeyoun wanted and enlarging them created a key.  

As we got closer to publication, Alex pointed out that we were missing lots races readers would be interested. I drug my feet, not wanting to go back to dozens of secretary of state websites before realizing that I'd just need to copy/paste a single candidate's votes to get the vote total for each uncontested race, not several candidates I had when collecting senate turnout. This gave us a ton of races so I shrunk the slope charts down to fit 10 in a column, essentially making the whole thing a [bar chart](https://imgur.com/Fyp5tec).  

The design got postpublication pushback: "Readers don't know where or what GA-4, you need to offer some human context." There's some truth to this. My reporting on this piece was done with spreadsheets and I didn't have much to add about individual races. I know Ocasio-Cortez won my district, but couldn't tell you my district number. Still, I didn't want to add section with photos of candidates and details about it single race. That's been writen dozens of times already! And turnout shifts in one can be explained by its particulars; zooming out shows that there's actually trend. Matthew whipped up some [maps](https://imgur.com/Y1SGZap) with [mapshaper](https://imgur.com/F95ukMB---http://mapshaper.org/) to provide some of that context without overwelming the rest of the piece.

## [These 20 Representatives Have Not Had a Primary Challenger for at Least a Decade](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/30/us/elections/representatives-running-unopposed-uncontested-primaries.html)

When Crowley got primaried after not facing primary opponent for over decade, Troy wondered how unusual it was to have a streak of uncontested primaries. I had House primary data sitting around from the turnout project and whipped up a chart showing how long it had been since each incumbent had been [challenged in a primary](https://imgur.com/tEBGPC4).

Trying to turn the piece around before the news cycle moved on, Troy started writing and I started checking the data. It was way messier than I had hoped. The FEC collects [election results](https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/electionresults.shtml) from states, but the names and FECIDs aren't 100% consistent between years. We ended up spending a day checking everything.  

I had big dreams of [remaking the nfl streak chart](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/28/eli-manning-milestone/index.html---https://imgur.com/oFJhwPR), but FEC didn't start posting spreadsheets till 2000. So we stuck to current incumbents. Going back farther, the results degrade from [HTML in 1998](https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1998/sch.htm---https://imgur.com/HDL7OSc) to [PDF in 1994](https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1994/federalelections94.pdf---https://imgur.com/EeMLOks) to [not proving primary results in 1992](https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1992/federalelections92.pdf---https://imgur.com/1xyW3fR).  DeLauro and Lowey still had active unopposed streaks, so I called their offices to find out when they had their last primary--the person who picked up the phone for Lowey asked around for me and no one knew! 

To provide more historical context, I made a [line chart](https://imgur.com/hZjU3JK) that didn't relay on streaks. I wanted to get a little more information in it, so I switched to two stacked area charts showing [the number of candidates](https://imgur.com/IDvwR6K) in each house primary. To keep the piece focused on incumbents, I kept that form but switched to showing [how often they were challenged and how often they won](https://imgur.com/GOQvzXb). If I had seen Boatright's chart showing [competitive challenges earlier](https://imgur.com/h7bHtY0---https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/06/05/heres-what-weve-learned-from-the-u-s-congressional-primaries-so-far/?utm_term=.c607cbf9096b), I would have added another layer showing the percentage of incumbents facing non competitive primaries. 

Troy did all the styling and fixes in illustrator, like making time go left to right (whoops). I wish there was more time to report out _why_ incumbents aren't challenged: the [Queens machine](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/nyregion/joseph-crowley-party-boss-queens.html) and [New York ballot access](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/ballot-frustrating-inefficient-article-1.3289020) create some formidable barriers. But between Kennedy retiring and a mass shooting, we had already missed the beat of the news cycle.

## [Republicans Dominate State Politics. But Democrats Made a Dent This Year.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/10/upshot/republicans-dominate-state-politics-but-democrats-made-a-dent.html)

Last spring I took a look at state and local [election results](https://i.imgur.com/LYxA4bF.png), wondering if more Republican state legislators would lead to more [pre-emption](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/upshot/blue-cities-want-to-make-their-own-rules-red-states-wont-let-them.html), The National Conference of State Legislatures tracks the number of legislators over time, so I tried [plotting all of them](https://imgur.com/1Kqyuvj) (a [line chart](https://imgur.com/SqDAfKI) is probably a better way to show this information).

The raw number of representives also isn't that meaningful (New Hampshire's lower chamber has 400 members!), so I looked at control of upper and lower chambers in each state over the last hundred years with a [cartogram](https://imgur.com/s1Egu2U).  National trends are hard to pick out with this form; state boxes are only 70 pixels wide so each election is only a pixel wide. 

To pull those trends out, I made a [stacked "area" chart](https://imgur.com/X4azqdJ) out of the state's intitals. Changes in control are highlighted and the states with split chambers are vertically centered so the outline of chart shows changes in control. I was happy with this form--it'd make a great poster!--but didn't have a story to attach it to so it sat untouched till Bui and Emily started working on post midterms state legislative piece.

Bui build similar charts for governors and overall state control, then dropped the [baseline](https://imgur.com/NnIwauh) to make them denser. I thought the shape of the outlines looked nice, but with three catorgies it is totally unnessary. After publishing, Kevin pointed the Times had previously published both [types](https://imgur.com/8joPL2f).

## [See How Close the Results Are in Arizona, Georgia and Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/10/us/elections/2018-possible-midterm-recounts-georgia-florida-arizona.html)

sadly real data wasn't quite so cool

tried yellow to highlight recont zones but color was hard

archie suggested a cross hatch and pulling the date ticks oout more

and the real data was more exciting! [last chart]
