## [Is There Something Wrong with Democracy?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/24/world/is-there-something-wrong-with-democracy.html)

Larry [sketched out](https://imgur.com/9gl9sPf) a Hans Rosling style connected scatter plot about democracy and I turned it into an [unstyled animation](https://imgur.com/XiKMDYi) with a bit of d3. 

The tricky bit: he was producing an actual video, not a webpage. I found an objectively bad way of [exporting](https://roadtolarissa.com/d3-mp4/) a d3 animation as a video by taking a bunch of screenshots with a headless browser and stitching them together.

I wish there was an easier way of doing this. [Chart Party](https://imgur.com/tEN3bkf---https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_SsIKgwvz4) does incredibly creative work and I think some of that's because video lets you walk people through complex forms in a way that's even more friendly than scrolling. I'd like to try, but learning a whole new way of working, especially with something that requires sharing more of yourself, is [daunting](https://imgur.com/zgthTOM---https://www.youtube.com/user/jonbois/videos).



## [The Rise and Fall of Same-Sex Marriage Bans](https://roadtolarissa.com/same-sex-legal/)

Basically a stacked bar chart with two twists. 

First, labeling the states lets you follow an individual state over time. States that change are highlighted with bolding and tweaking the sort order so you can easily count how many states switched into each group. This doesn't do great job highlighting which group the state [switched from](https://imgur.com/a/gWSUy), but that's not too important here since the progression is always No Law → Ban → Legal.  

Second, the baseline is adjusted so that No Law always sits in middle of the chart. This puts more emphasis on the total number of places with bans.

## [Rich White Boys Stay Rich. Black Boys Don’t](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html)

Kevin did most of the charting work on this piece - I just got pulled in as an expert dot animator. 

We started out with a [SVG animation](https://bl.ocks.org/1wheel/7ddedc637c07104886f6909215a41b7f), tried out Elijah's [canvas sankey particles](https://bl.ocks.org/emeeks/e9d64d27f286e61493c9) and ended up rewriting in regl to get more dots on the screen.

The final version gets better performance by passing in [array of attributes](https://bl.ocks.org/1wheel/9b3bcc4ce8266913c0a0ddd4120a41de) to the vertex shader - after publishing the very helpful [regl chat](gitter.im/mikolalysenko/regl) showed me how to fix.

This piece probably has the worst data to ink ratio of anything I've made; 10,000 dots to show 10 data points. I think it would have been interesting to try show more of distributions across race/sex/parent income at once, but when you've got such important numbers going on big a couple of them can work.

I got a reader email complaining how long it took watch the animation. I made a [static version](https://bl.ocks.org/1wheel/1629f9dbc0d48137ac3a8cb395e5ec4c) incorporating some of his suggestions]. Definitely more information dense,  but it doesn't have quite the same impact.  


## [Every Top Three Grossing Movie Over The Last 25 Years](https://roadtolarissa.com/top-3-movies/)

After seeing Axios's [piece](https://www.axios.com/black-panther-box-office-titanic-top-3-north-america-avatar-star-wars-32a35770-59fc-4ccc-bd5b-3a85d7144266.html) on Black Panther becoming one of the highest (non-inflation adjusted) grossing movies of all time, I was curious how many other movies had done so. Originally, I copied the step interpolation - it looks cool! - [but Lisa's post](https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-altitude/) convinced me that it was a little misleading for cumulative data. 

I like the scrubbability of seeing the scale suddenly increase when there's a new record, but some of the drama gets lost if you scroll too quickly. Updating the y scale elastically (like this [this path](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-redistricting/) or [this zoom](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/27/world/greenland-is-melting-away.html)) instead of instantly might have worked better. 

Grabbing data from Axios instead of having to find it, scrape it and check for errors is the best. In theory, I should have updated with more recent data (Infinity War!) and gotten a better sample of top grossing movies in the 80s...

## [Selling Low and Buying High Can Beat the Market](https://roadtolarissa.com/sell-strat/)

I got the idea for this piece after Feburary dip in stock prices and seeing comments like ["I like to look at it as stocks going on sale. Time to buy!"](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7vngon/dont_sell_the_stocks_in_your_retirement_portfolio/dttomu6/). Is it actually better to buy after a dip in prices? Or should you sell?

[Elliot Bently](http://ejb.github.io/2017/06/25/trading-bot-sketches.html) made a [trading simulator](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/build-your-own-trading-bot/) for the WSJ last year that came close to answering my question, but getting trying to understand impact of tweaking the trading thresholds required [fiddling](https://i.imgur.com/uFl91hM.png) with a text field and waiting for an animation to play. [Animations](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-win-a-trade-war/) are good for introducing a concept, but they start to get frustrating when they block interaction. 

Besides disabling the animation, I took a step and a half up the [ladder of abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/) and showed the entire space of different trading thresholds with a series of [heatmaps](https://i.imgur.com/zPehFto.png). People don't click on buttons as much as we'd like to image and mobile is a huge design constraint, but I don't think graphics desks are exploiting the possiblies of the medium when we don't give readers a chance to explore and examine our models without pulling down an IPython Notebook.

Making something like this is more work; the [rough draft](https://bl.ocks.org/1wheel/raw/18b49093b0a41888d4ff45281cb66f66/0b4c9ee45c6d625c7fdd48101963cdb70de190fa/) got [banged out](https://i.imgur.com/zNzmoCq.png) in a evening, but all the polishing touches took [more time](https://i.imgur.com/zPehFto.png) to get right and the [code](https://github.com/1wheel/roadtolarissa/blob/master/source/sell-strat/_script.js) ended up pretty ugly (didn't want to prematurally optimize, but dragging the date slider was laggy so I hacked in caching without cleanly rewriting thinking the finish line was close… it wasn't).
