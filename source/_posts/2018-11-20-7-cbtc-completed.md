After years of weekend closures, the MTA announced the completion of the 7 train's new, [computerized signal system](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/nyregion/new-york-subway-signals.html) today. 

Replacing finicky electromechanical devices designed a century ago, modernized signals increase the number of trains able to run, reduce "signal problems ahead", and lower costs. To fix the subway, the MTA plans to spend $20 billion upgrading every lineâ€™s signals over 10 years.

Past experience suggests this be will difficult. 


##  The <b class='line-L'>L</b> and <b class='line-7'>7</b> Signal Upgrades Were Late and Over Budget

The MTA has corrected some problems: 

- longer shutdowns
- hopefully no bad finance
- better train procurment

## How the <b class='line-7'>7</b> Signal Completion Date Slipped Over Time






<div id='two-years' class='full-width'></div>

Plauged by software issues, the last two years of work took four years to finish

has historically struggled with software


Byford wants to "buy off the shelf"... how will that help?

## Keeping the old block signals in place is hard

One of biggest custom software compenets is overlaied signals

Each line will have years of weekend and overnight closures.
also overnight service will help but it also increases the risk

## Words idk

They're the cornerstone of the MTA's plan to fix subway by spending $20 billion upgrading every line's signals over 10 years.


Signal upgrades on the L and 7 ran years behind schedule and over budget.

The MTA Finally Finished Upgrading the Signals on the 7. The Last Two Years of Work Took Four Years to Finish.


Keeping multiple, more complex projects on schedule will be even harder. After more delays were announced this spring, the new head of New York City Transit, Andy Byford, tried [intervening](https://www.wsj.com/articles/7-line-upgrade-means-more-delays-1524780156). The launch still got to pushed back to November.
