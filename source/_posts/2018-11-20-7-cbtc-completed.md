After years of weekend closures, the MTA announced the completion of the 7 train's new, [computerized signal system](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/nyregion/new-york-subway-signals.html) today. 

Replacing finicky electromechanical devices designed a century ago, modernized signals increase the number of trains able to run, reduce "signal problems ahead", and lower costs. To fix the subway, the MTA plans to spend $20 billion upgrading every line’s signals over 10 years.

Past experience suggests this be will difficult. 


##  The <b class='line-L'>L</b> and <b class='line-7'>7</b> Signal Upgrades Were Late and Over Budget

The MTA has corrected some things that caused problems in the past. They’re [buying](https://twitter.com/ModernSignaling/status/1053394646892720128) train cars that work with computer signals without retrofitting, a previous source of delays. The new head of New York City Transit, Andy Byford, has proposed shutting down all weekend and night travel for years while a line’s signals are upgraded; the intermittent shutdowns on the 7 meant that needing serveral additional days of [trackwork](https://www.wsj.com/articles/7-line-upgrade-means-more-delays-1524780156) could add a month to the project timeline.

There are still problem though. 

## How the <b class='line-7'>7</b> Signal Completion Date Slipped Over Time

<div id='two-years' class='full-width'></div>

Plagued by software issues, the last two years of work took four years to finish. The MTA has historically struggled with software. On [previous signal project](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/cadiv/segb/views/document/sections/section8/8_5_1.cfm), ad hoc deployment errors caused interruptions to train service, a voice communctions system with only vague spefications when put into use and UIs only prototyped in PowerPoint were hard to use and had to be redone.  

Byford says he wants to "buy off the shelf” to cut costs and reduce delays. His previous job as CEO of the Toronto Transit Commissions provides a clue about what that’ll entail. 

## Combining old and new signaling systems isn’t easy

Toronto was trying to update 50 year old signals. To avoid an interruption in service, they were keeping the old electormechinal signals in place and overlaying the compterized signals on top of them. This is hard to do: the computerized signals needs heavily customized software that simulates how the old signals and interlocks work. And the amount of track work increases; instead of just putting down beacons that let the train car know its exact position, the old signals also require extensive modifications.

Faced with mounting delays, Byford simplified the work to be done. Everything is computerized.  

- one of biggest custom software components is overlaid signals
- 90s confident L train quote "simulate existing signals in memory”

MTA is conservite and still overlaying signals. This accounts for a signfitent chunk of project timeline on the R signal moderinization projection currently underway:

FHA says not necessary.

## This matters!

- Each line will have years of weekend and overnight closures; more years won't be fun
- huge amount of money, already lots of debt.  subway will be in a bad place

## Words idk

They're the cornerstone of the MTA's plan to fix subway by spending $20 billion upgrading every line's signals over 10 years.

Signal upgrades on the L and 7 ran years behind schedule and over budget.

The MTA can’t control some causes of delay.  Originally sheduled for 2008, work didn’t start on the 7’s signals till 2011 because of “[funding availability](https://cbcny.org/sites/default/files/report_mta_10202009.pdf).” 

The MTA Finally Finished Upgrading the Signals on the 7. The Last Two Years of Work Took Four Years to Finish.


Keeping multiple, more complex projects on schedule will be even harder. After more delays were announced this spring, the new head of New York City Transit, Andy Byford, tried [intervening](https://www.wsj.com/articles/7-line-upgrade-means-more-delays-1524780156). The launch still got to pushed back to November.
