After years of weekend closures, the MTA announced the completion of the 7 train's new, [computerized signal system](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/nyregion/new-york-subway-signals.html) today. 

Replacing finicky electromechanical devices designed a century ago, modernized signals increase the number of trains able to run, reduce "signal problems ahead", and lower costs. To fix the subway, the MTA plans to spend $20 billion upgrading every lineâ€™s signals over 10 years.

Past experience suggests this be will difficult. 


##  The <b class='line-L'>L</b> and <b class='line-7'>7</b> Signal Upgrades Were Late and Over Budget

The MTA has corrected some things that caused problems in the past: 

- longer shutdowns
- buying trains with CBTC ready to go
- hopefully no GFC to slow down start

But the last four years

## How the <b class='line-7'>7</b> Signal Completion Date Slipped Over Time

<div id='two-years' class='full-width'></div>

- Plagued by software issues, the last two years of work took four years to finish
- MTA has historically struggled with software. On ATC they tried to speed things up by accepting a UI they'd only seen and power point and not specifying requirements for voice.
- Byford wants to "buy off the shelf"... what might that entail?

## Keeping the old signals in place is hard

- one of biggest custom software components is overlaid signals
- 90s confident L train quote "simulate existing signals in memory"

aws also requires tricky physical works. here i'll highlight aws items:

- FHA says not necessary

## This matters!

- Each line will have years of weekend and overnight closures; more years won't be fun
- huge amount of money, subway will be in a bad place

## Words idk

They're the cornerstone of the MTA's plan to fix subway by spending $20 billion upgrading every line's signals over 10 years.


Signal upgrades on the L and 7 ran years behind schedule and over budget.

The MTA Finally Finished Upgrading the Signals on the 7. The Last Two Years of Work Took Four Years to Finish.


Keeping multiple, more complex projects on schedule will be even harder. After more delays were announced this spring, the new head of New York City Transit, Andy Byford, tried [intervening](https://www.wsj.com/articles/7-line-upgrade-means-more-delays-1524780156). The launch still got to pushed back to November.
