[In the Race for Registered Voters, Republicans Are Gaining](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/25/us/elections/voter-registration.html)

Quick look at voter registration trends across a couple of key swing states. I would have liked to do more, but the some states like Virgina and Michigan don't have partisan voter registration and others don't provide monthly registration numbers. 

I was a little slow putting everything together; 538 put out a [similar piece](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-voter-registration-gains-probably-arent-gains-at-all/) yesterday  



[This small Indiana county sends more people to prison than San Francisco and Durham, N.C., combined. Why?](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/upshot/new-geography-of-prisons.html)
Hi! I'm one of the authors (Adam), ama. 

This was the first thing I started working on at the nyt, back in April. Josh had already done a ton of leg work getting access to the data and researching interesting areas to explore. 

I spent a couple of weeks exploring the data and making charts in R. NCRP has a row of data of data for almost every prisoner in America. It is personally identifying, so I had to remote into a windows vm w/o internet access to do all the analysis. States also don't report numbers to the Bureau of Justice Statistics consistently, so we had to contact individual states so figure out which numbers were accurate.    

Studies of our criminal justice system typically use publicly accessible state level data from the National Prison Survey. This is significantly easier to work with, but using states as the unit of analysis masks substantial intrastate differences: 

> The stark disparities in how counties punish crime show the limits of recent state and federal changes to reduce the number of inmates. Far from Washington and state capitals, county prosecutors and judges continue to wield great power over who goes to prison and for how long. And many of them have no interest in reducing the prison population.


[Which Debate Clips Got Replayed the Most on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/09/29/us/elections/debate-moments.html)
We were curious how different channels covered the debate. Pundits are at their most influential post debate, strongly shaping how the public views the debate. 

Starting with a list of replayed clips and their start times & durations, I tried bucketing clips by their [start minute](http://imgur.com/a/f1e3A). It wasn't quite granular enough to see the interesting movements. 

I also played with a sort of [waterfall graph](http://imgur.com/a/flc5L) to show both the start and duration of clips. While a little strange, I really liked this approach and think it could have worked, we were running short on time (the data was only ready yesterday around 1 PM and there's another debate coming up soon). We ended up going with a simpler form that doesn't try to show each individual clip but still incorporates the duration data. 

Charts are were made with d3, data from the [Internet Archive](http://politicaladarchive.org/debate-project).


[The Ways Out of World Group Stage](http://www.roadtolarissa.com/worlds-group/)
I spent most of last weekend watching the first half of group play in worlds and I was curious which teams had the best shot of advancing to quarterfinals. 

I worked on a piece for the [upshot on eurocup advancement](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/16/upshot/euro-2016-how-teams-can-advance-to-the-next-round.html) and wanted to try something similar for League of Legends.

Since there are still six remaining matches in each, there are a ton more possible outcomes. I would have liked to show more interaction between the possible outcomes. Since I couldn't come up with a good way of showing a 6d hypercube, I grouped primary by team with linked hover to give an idea of those interactions. Some kind of [tree](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/upshot/nfl-playoff-picture-what-vikings-fans-should-cheer-for.html) might also have worked.

[How Trump Can Influence Climate Change](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/08/us/trump-climate-change.html?_r=0)
There wasn't a ton of data to work with here - just a couple of projections for 2025 emissions - so I showed some random numbers on the first slide to convey that the projections were uncertain and make the page more visually interesting. Hopefully less upsetting than the [jittery dials](http://vis4.net/blog/posts/jittery-gauges-election-forecast/) on the election forecast page

We went back and forth a little bit on the scaling of the y axis. We didn't want domain of the axis to equal the extent of the projections since at first glance it'd look like emissions were going to 0. But starting the y axis at 0 wouldn't leave enough room to label the wedges. We ended up saving about 1/3 of the y scale for white space under the chart for the but still managed to [extend the y axis to 0](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce/status/806892521813114880) (couldn't figure out how to do it on mobile though).
