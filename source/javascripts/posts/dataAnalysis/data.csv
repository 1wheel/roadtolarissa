2007 (80th),80,SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Academy Award of Merit),1,"To the EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY for the development of photographic emulsion technologies incorporated into the Kodak Vision2 family of color negative films. These new technologies are breakthroughs in film speed, grain and sharpness that have made a significant impact on the motion picture industry. The Vision2 family allows wider use of high-speed color negative film, lower light levels on set and faster set-ups. Most importantly, Vision2 improves the overall picture quality in theatrical presentation. [Laboratory]",
2007 (80th),80,SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award),1,"To DR. DOUG ROBLE, NAFEES BIN ZAFAR and RYO SAKAGUCHI for the development of the fluid simulation system at Digital Domain. This influential and flexible production-proven system incorporates innovative algorithms and refined adaptations of published methods to achieve large-scale water effects. [Digital Imaging Technology]",
2007 (80th),80,SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award),1,"To NICK RASMUSSEN, RON FEDKIW and FRANK LOSASSO PETTERSON for the development of the Industrial Light & Magic fluid simulation system. This production-proven simulation system achieves large-scale water effects within ILM's Zeno framework. It includes integrating particle level sets, parallel computation, and tools that enable the artistic direction of the results. [Digital Imaging Technology]",
2007 (80th),80,SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award),1,"To CHRISTIEN TINSLEY for the creation of the transfer techniques for creating and applying 2D and 3D makeup known as ""Tinsley Transfers."" These techniques allow quick and precisely repeatable application of 2D makeup such as tattoos, bruises and birthmarks, as well as 3D prosthetic appliances ranging in size from small wounds to entire torsos. They utilize self-adhesive material that features an unprecedented combination of tissue-thin edges, resilience, flexibility and water resistance, while requiring no dangerous solvents. [Systems]",
2007 (80th),80,SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Technical Achievement Award),1,"To JÖRG PÖHLER and RÜDIGER KLEINKE of OTTEC Technology GmbH for the design and development of the battery-operated series of fog machines known as ""Tiny Foggers."" The operating characteristics of this compact, well-engineered and remote-controllable package make possible a range of safe special effects that would be totally impractical with larger, more conventional fog units. [Stage Operations]",
