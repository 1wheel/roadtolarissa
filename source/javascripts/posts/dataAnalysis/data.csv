2007 (80th),80,SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Academy Award of Merit),1,"To the EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY for the development of photographic emulsion technologies incorporated into the Kodak Vision2 family of color negative films. These new technologies are breakthroughs in film speed, grain and sharpness that have made a significant impact on the motion picture industry. The Vision2 family allows wider use of high-speed color negative film, lower light levels on set and faster set-ups. Most importantly, Vision2 improves the overall picture quality in theatrical presentation. [Laboratory]",
2007 (80th),80,SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award),1,"To DR. DOUG ROBLE, NAFEES BIN ZAFAR and RYO SAKAGUCHI for the development of the fluid simulation system at Digital Domain. This influential and flexible production-proven system incorporates innovative algorithms and refined adaptations of published methods to achieve large-scale water effects. [Digital Imaging Technology]",
2007 (80th),80,SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL AWARD (Scientific and Engineering Award),1,"To NICK RASMUSSEN, RON FEDKIW and FRANK LOSASSO PETTERSON for the development of the Industrial Light & Magic fluid simulation system.
