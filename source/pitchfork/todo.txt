- sun kil moon is the only one in the top 10 of albums of 2010-2014 not to make the decade end list after heckling a pitchfork reviewer on stage
- Fame Monster and Red made the best of the decade, but not the best of the year.
- James Blake and How to Dress Well both had three best of the year albums and nothing in best of the decade; their albums in the later half of the decade that scored 5.8 and 6.8 might have removed some of luster.
- Beyonc√©'s and Burial's December albums didn't make the end of the year list.




All of pitchfork's best of the year lists into one table.

I played around with trying encode position, with slope charts and scatter plots, but settled on a table for easy scanning and density of text. Cutting off artist names isn't ideal, but couldn't figure out how else to squeeze everything in.

With more time, I would have collected the original review scores and shown artist albums that didn't make any lists on mouseover to give a better idea of their career arc. 

The log scaling for the decade bars was also a little fiddly. I wanted to make the legend control the scaling and rank the years by summing the bars ; maybe with a linear or a flat scale 2010 would score higher?
