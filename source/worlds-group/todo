annos
B
- C9 avoids elimination with a win against SKT
- Without two wins, IM and FW are out
- If SKT loses to C9 and IM, it could be eliminated

C
- EDG's loss to the 1-2 INT means it has larger chance of elimination than AHQ
- Likewise, INT's win over EDG gives it more ways to advance than H2k
- If INT lose the first game to EDG, almost all their advancement options disappear. 

D
- 3 way tie if RNG, SSG and TSM each beat each other once again
- A win for SSG almost ensures that they won't be eliminated
